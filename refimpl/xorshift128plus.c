/* This generator has been replaced by xoroshiro128plus, which is
   significantly faster and has better statistical properties.

   It might be nonetheless useful for languages in which low-level rotate
   instructions are not available. Due to the relatively short period it
   is acceptable only for applications with a mild amount of parallelism;
   otherwise, use a xorshift1024* generator.

   Note that the lowest bit of this generator is an LSFR, and thus it is
   slightly less random than the other bits. We suggest to use a sign test
   to extract a random Boolean value.

   The state must be seeded so that it is not everywhere zero. If you have
   a 64-bit seed, we suggest to seed a splitmix64 generator and use its
   output to fill s.

   A previous version of this generator was adding the two halves of the
   newly computed state. This version adds the two halves of the *current*
   state (as xoroshiro128plus does), which improves speed due to better
   internal parallelization from the CPU. The resulting streams are off by
   one step. */
