/* This is a fast, top-quality generator. If 1024 bits of state are too
   much, try a xoroshiro128+ generator.

   Note that the three lowest bits of this generator are LSFRs, and thus
   they are slightly less random than the other bits. We suggest to use a
   sign test to extract a random Boolean value.

   The state must be seeded so that it is not everywhere zero. If you have
   a 64-bit seed, we suggest to seed a splitmix64 generator and use its
   output to fill s. */
